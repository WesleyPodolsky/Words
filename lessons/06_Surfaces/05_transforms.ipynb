    "The most important transformations that you can make to an image are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scale**: Change the size of the image.\n",
    "* **Rotate**: Rotate the image by a given angle.\n",
    "* **Flip**: Flip the image horizontally, vertically, or both.\n",

    "## Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review the program `06_transform.py` and run it. This program will\n",
    "   demonstrate several types of transformations. You've seen several of them in\n",
    "   programs already, so most of them should be familiar. \n",
    "2. Update one of your previous programs ( your updates to\n",
    "   `04_gravity_bounce_vec.py` would be a good choice ) to include a\n",
    "   transformation. For instance. you could rotate the image of the ball ( or\n",
    "   frog, whatever you want ) as it moves, or make it get squashed when it hits\n",

    "* Use the frog image, taken from the spritesheet. \n",
    "* When the frog jumps, make it stretch taller ( scale the image vertically )\n",
    "* When the frog hits the ground, make it squish shorter ( scale the image vertically )\n",
    "* When the frog is in the air, make it rotate. \n"
