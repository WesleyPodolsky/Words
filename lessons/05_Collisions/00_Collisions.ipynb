    "# Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our games have just involved moving things about a screen, but there\n",
    "haven't been any crashes or explosions. In this lesson, we will explore the\n",
    "concept of collisions in game development using Python. Collisions are a\n",
    "fundamental aspect of many games, determining when objects interact with each\n",
    "other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions occur when two or more objects come into contact with each other. In\n",
    "games, detecting collisions is crucial for various interactions, such as player\n",
    "movements, enemy attacks, and object pickups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bounding Box Collisions**: Simplest form, using rectangles or boxes around objects.\n",
    "- **Circle Collisions**: Using circles to detect overlaps, often used for circular objects.\n",
    "- **Pixel Perfect Collisions**: More precise, checking individual pixels for overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two types of collections are the most common, because they are very\n",
    "fast, but they are not always the most accurate. Pixel perfect collisions are\n",
    "the most accurate, but they are also the slowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have two sprites, in the shape of stars: \n",
    "\n",
    "![stars](images/collisions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dotted line around each sprite represents the bounding box, which is the\n",
    "rectangle that surrounds the sprite's image. In the diagram, you can see that the\n",
    "bounding boxes are overlapping, which means that the sprites are colliding, but\n",
    "the images of the sprites are not touching. So, the computer thinks there is a\n",
    "collision, but the player does not! This is why bounding box collisions are not\n",
    "always the most accurate. However, it's really easy, so we'll learn those first. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an example of bounding box collisions, see the code in `01_dino_jump.py`.\n",
    "This dino jump game is really terrible! The player doesn't actually jump, it\n",
    "just moves up or down. It's clearly not finished, but it does show you how\n",
    "collisions work. \n"

    "Here is the code that checks for collisions in the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    obstacles = pygame.sprite.Group() # Create obstacles group\n",
    "\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    obstacle = Obstacle() # Add obstacles to a group\n",

    "## Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open  `01_dino_jump.py` \n",
    "2. Make the game properly object oriented, like other games have been. There\n",
    "   should be a class for all of the major parts, including a `Game` object that\n",
    "   has the main loop, and an object for settings. \n",
    "3. Make the player jump when the space bar is pressed, rather than move up and\n",
    "   down with the arrow keys. \n",
    "4. Add a `score` attribute to the player object, and update it for each obstacle\n",
    "   that is avoided.\n",
    "5. Change the player to a dinosaur and the obstacles to cactuses or pterodactyls.\n",
    "6. Add a game over screen when the player collides with an obstacle.\n",
    "7. Add a restart button to the game over screen.\n",
    "8. Add a high score to the game over screen.\n",
    "9. Draw a ground for the dinosaur to run on.\n",

    "## More Rectangles\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rect object, which our sprites use for their position and size, has a number\n",
    "of useful methods for working with rectangles. The first things is that in\n",
    "addition to `.x` and `.y` for thei position of the rect's upper left corner,\n",
    "there are also `.left`, `.right`, `.top`, and `.bottom` attributes. These are\n",
    "the x and y coordinates of the left, right, top, and bottom edges of the\n",
    "rectangle. YOu can both read and write these attributes, so here is a nice way\n",
    "to see if a retangle is off the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "screen_rect = screen.get_rect()\n",
    "\n",
    "if player.rect.right < screen_rect.left:\n",
    "    player.rect.left = screen_rect.right\n",
    "\n",
    "if player.rect.left > screen_rect.right:\n",
    "    player.rect.right = screen_rect.left\n",
    "\n",
    " ... etc ...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To move the rectangle, we have been using assignment to the `.x` and `.y`\n",
    "attributes, but we can also use the `.move` method. This method takes two\n",
    "arguments, the amount to move in the x and y directions, and returns a new\n",
    "rectangle that is the result of moving the original rectangle by that amount.\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "player.rect = player.rect.move(1, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this creats a *new* rect, and does not change the original rect, so\n",
    "you need to assign the result back to the original rect. But, there is also the\n",
    "`.move_ip` method, which stands for \"move in place\". This method takes the same\n",
    "arguments as `.move`, but it changes the original rect. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "player.rect.move_ip(1, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other operations to perform on rectangles, such as `inflate`,\n",
    "`clamp`, `clip`, and `union`. You can read about them in the [Pygame\n",
    "documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html#pygame.Rect).\n",
