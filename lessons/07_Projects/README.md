# Build Your Own Game

You've now learned enough about PyGame to create your own game! Here are starters for 
seven different games you can build. Each game has a brief description of the gameplay
and mechanics to help you get started.

Take these instructions as a starting point, but it's totally your game! Do what
ever you want to make it fun and interesting.

## 1. Flappy Bird

Guide a bird through an endless series of pipes by tapping to make it flap. The
goal is to avoid hitting the pipes while navigating through the gaps. The game
combines gravity with simple, yet challenging gameplay.

## 2. League Invaders

Inspired by the classic **Space Invaders**, the player controls a laser cannon
to defend Earth from waves of alien invaders. Move left and right to shoot the
aliens while avoiding their projectiles, and destroy all invaders before they
reach the bottom.

## 3. Frogger

Help your frog cross a busy road and a dangerous river to reach safe zones at
the top of the screen. Dodge traffic, jump on floating logs and turtles, and
avoid falling into the water to guide the frog to safety.

## 4. Asteroids

Pilot a spaceship through a field of asteroids and enemy UFOs, shooting them to
survive. Large asteroids break into smaller ones, and the action ramps up as you
avoid collisions and take out enemies in this endless, fast-paced game.

## 5. Lunar Lander

Safely land a lunar module on the moon by controlling its descent with limited
fuel. Use careful thrusting to manage speed and aim for landing zones of varying
difficulty, all while battling gravity and avoiding a crash.

## 6. Tank War

Engage in a 2-player tank battle in an arena filled with obstacles. Move your
tank, fire projectiles, and use strategic shots to outmaneuver and destroy your
opponent before they destroy you.

## 7. Dino Run

Control a dinosaur running through a desert, jumping over obstacles like cacti
and ducking under flying pterodactyls. The game speeds up as you go, and the
goal is to survive as long as possible to achieve a high score.
